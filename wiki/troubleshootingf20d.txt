# What to do when... ? #

## ... my local repo and my fork are behind the sigmah-dev upstream one ? ##

What to understand while playing with ''git'' is that you will actually play with three repository:
  - ''upstream'' (or also named ''sigmah-dev''): the official online sigmah-dev repository which contains all accepted commits from all parties
  - ''origin'': your online fork repository on GitHub, which is a fork of the ''sigmah-dev'' repository
  - your local repository

If the upstream official ''sigmah-dev'' repo has new changes and your local repo and your online fork are no more up-to-date, the route to follow to update them is: 1. update your local repo, 2. push those updates to your online fork.

In command lines from the source folder of your local repository, it will look like:
<code bash>
# 0. List remotes to be sure of the names to use
git remote
#_example result begin_
#origin
#sigmah-dev
#_example result end_

# 1. Pull changes from the upstream 'sigmah-dev' repository to the master branch of your local repo
git pull sigmah-dev master

# 2. Push changes from your local repo to your online fork 'origin'
git push origin

## ... I get "Starting of Tomcat failed" in Netbeans ? ##

In your Tomcat "bin" directory, do the following replacement in the "catalina.bat" file:

**original part**
<code>
:noJuliConfig
set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %LOGGING_CONFIG%"

:noJuliManager
set "JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %LOGGING_MANAGER%"
</code>

**replaced part**
<code>
:noJuliConfig
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %LOGGING_CONFIG%

:noJuliManager
set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% %LOGGING_MANAGER%
</code>

## ... operator class "gin_trgm_ops" does not exist for access method "gin" ##

If you get this error while running Sigmah or while installing (database migration):

  operator class "gin_trgm_ops" does not exist for access method "gin"

It's because your sigmah database lacks the [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgtrgm.html|pg_trgm]] extension (which is useful for full-text search since we can't do that in pure SQL).

Use a superuser account (postgres) to install the extension in the sigmah database:

  psql --username postgres sigmah --command "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;"
