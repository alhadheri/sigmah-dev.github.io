<h2 class="sectionedit3" id="what_is_sigmah">1.1 What is Sigmah?</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Sigmah is an initiative by a group of NGOs to develop open source project management software for the international aid sector.
</p>

<p>
Sigmah is open source software for the shared management of international aid projects. The software is simple, flexible and intuitive and allows each organization to organize its own work methods, and thereby improve the quality of its programs.
</p>

<p>
Sigmah is the result of a participatory project facilitated by a group of organizations  from the sector. Using Groupe URD’s expertise and that of our technical and voluntary partners, Steering Cooperative members are able to develop the Sigmah software in order to address expressed needs.  Sigmah software is a common asset which is made available to everyone.
</p>

</div>
<!-- EDIT3 SECTION "1.1 What is Sigmah?" [136-905] -->
<h2 class="sectionedit4" id="what_is_sigmah_summer_of_code">1.2 What is Sigmah Summer of Code?</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Sigmah Summer of Code is 4 months of collaboration between developers and their mentor, working on the Sigmah source code.
</p>

<p>
Sigmah Summer of Code is an opportunity for developers to increase their knowledge of codes, to learn about how open source community works together, and become part of the Sigmah community while helping to improve a commonly owned asset in the public interest: Sigmah, open source software for humanitarian project management.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit5" id="sigmah_summer_of_code_google_summer_of_codewhat_differences_what_similarities">1.3 Sigmah Summer of Code / Google Summer of Code: what differences/what similarities?</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Sigmah has been selected for the Google Summer of Code (gsoc) for 3 years in a row. This has allowed the software and the Sigmah community to grow. We want to pursue and further develop this kind of activity, independently of whether we are selected by Google. The Sigmah Summer of Code program is open to all developers, whether students or not, no matter where they are in the world, so that they can work together developing the software, with or without the support of the GSoC.
Broadly speaking, the Sigmah Summer of Code provides a framework for recruiting, mobilizing, and supervising all the contributors who want to work on the Sigmah project during the summer. This framework is made available to any developer who is motivated, and  . Participants are required to make certain commitments, but students can decide to stop when they want.
A successful registration for the Google Summer of Code in connection with the Sigmah project will also be considered to be a registration for the Sigmah Summer of Code. And all those who are registered in the Sigmah Summer of Code can also decide to apply for the Google Summer of Code.
</p>

<p>
The table below presents the main differences and similarities between the Sigmah Summer of Code and the Google Summer of Code:

<p>
Sigmah Summer of Code has several goals:
</p>
<pre class="code">1. To increase the Sigmah project’s community of developers;
1. To develop the functionalities  of a commonly owned asset for the public good;
1. To train young developers and raise awareness about open source software;
1. To have fun, meet other developers from around the world and enjoy working together!</pre>

<h2 class="sectionedit10" id="how_does_it_work">1.7 How does it work?</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The Sigmah Summer of Code program has the following phases:
</p>
<pre class="code">1. Ideas for the development of the Sigmah software are disseminated ;
1. Interested developers choose their project from this list and submit their proposal online;
1. The proposals are analysed and developers are selected;
1. The developers who are selected are attributed a mentor with whom they will work on the chosen project.
1. The mentors and the developers provide mid-term progress evaluations.
1. The mentors provide a final evaluation of the developers’ progress at the end of the program; the developers submit a final review of their mentor and the program.
1. Developers and mentors are rewarded for their work (cf. [What’s in it for me?](#1.4_What%E2%80%99s_in_it_for_me?1.4))
1. Sigmah Summer of Code is a free will-based programme: anyone is free to quit at any time for any reason. People who quit (or don&#039;t achieve their objectives or fail their evaluations) will of course don&#039;t received the planned retributions except what they would have already learned and the pleasure we hope they have get before quitting.</pre>

<h2 class="sectionedit13" id="project_ideas_and_general_contributions">2.2 Project ideas and general contributions</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
First of all, as you may have guessed, the given project ideas will be mainly the core of the actual contribution you would be able to give to the Sigmah project. The process in which we are now is more the setting of a team to work this summer together on the Sigmah project (each member with his own core responsibility) than a set of individuals working totally individually on their own separate topic. Outside your main contribution (the project idea(s)) you&#039;ve chosen to work on, you can thus already select some features you would like to develop and list them in your application. The roadmap is full of them. All of those issues are suggested originally by the NGOs using Sigmah and are looking for their contributors!

Google Summer of Code, on the other hand, is a full-time well-paid job. Applicants therefore need to be available full-time, which means working at least 7 hours a day, 5 days a week (these are the French standards), and no more than 2 weeks of vacation during the 4 months of the program.
