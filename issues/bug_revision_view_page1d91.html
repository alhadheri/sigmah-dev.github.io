<td colspan="3"><b>Original need</b><br />
CARE Nederland, which has requested the development of the &quot;computation field&quot; feature (<a href="view0b8f.html?id=530" title="[closed] New type of orgunit/project field: computation field" class="resolved">0000530</a>) has expressed 3 new needs to extend this feature:<br />
- Received budget of an in-house project should be automatically calculated as the sum the received budgets of all linked &quot;Funding source&quot; projects with the &quot;Source of funding&quot; project model.<br />
- The &quot;budget spent&quot; of an in-house project should be calculated as the sum the spent budgets of all linked &quot;Funded&quot; projects with the &quot;Local partner&quot; project model.<br />
- The value of a received budget of a source of funding project should be the sum of the 5 &quot;Transfers&quot; fields of that project.<br />
<br />
This need is planned to be fully covered with the 3 following features:<br />
- <a href="viewbb33.html?id=864" title="[closed] Revise budget default field design" class="resolved">0000864</a> Revise budget default field design<br />
- (optional) <a href="viewa010.html?id=865" title="[new] Convenient use of budget information in computation field">0000865</a> Convenient use of budget information in computation field<br />
- and this <a href="view75cf.html?id=866" title="[closed] Computation field from linked projects" class="resolved">0000866</a> issue<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>New formula items</b><br />
<br />
To distinguished between funding sources and funded projects, two functions are available to get access to them in formulas: &quot;fundingSources()&quot; and &quot;fundedProjects()&quot;.<br />
<br />
To get the linked projects financial contributions in formulas, the symbol &quot;@contribution&quot; must be used.<br />
<br />
Since there can be several linked projects to a project, an aggregation function is required to compute a value from a linked projects field, or financial contributions. Requested aggregation functions at this time are only: average &quot;avg()&quot;, and sum &quot;sum()&quot;. Example: &quot;fundingSources().avg(@contribution)&quot;.<br />
<br />
Since there can be several project models used in linked project, a project model filter must be called each time a specific number field or computation field is requested. This field must be the exact project model name used in parameter of the linked projects access function. Example: &quot;fundedProjects(Local partner project v2).sum(field56)&quot;.<br />
<br />
A full example : &quot;fundingSources().sum(@contribution) - fundedProjects(Local partner project v2).sum(field56)&quot;<br />
<br />
If issue <a href="viewa010.html?id=865" title="[new] Convenient use of budget information in computation field">0000865</a> is developed, it will also be possible to easily aggregate budget with formulas like: &quot;fundedProjects().sum(@budget.spent)&quot; <br />
<br />
<b>User interface</b><br />
In the admin area, the computation field edition popup should be modified so that it is possible to get to know field codes of any project model.<br />
See attached mockup for suggestion.</td>
