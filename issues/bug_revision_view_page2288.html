<td colspan="3">In order to produce easily documents required in the daily life of a project, Sigmah shouldbe able to generate exports based on templates.<br />
It is expected to have documents generated in OpenDocument Text/MS Word/OpenDocument Spreashsheet/MS Excel file format. Most expected format is MS Word.<br />
<br />
<b>In the Administration Project model management screen</b><br />
A new tab should be added: &quot;Custom exports&quot;. This tab will be divided in two parts like the &quot;Import&quot; tab. Left side will be a table with two columns &quot;Custom export&quot;/&quot;Privacy group&quot;, and with three buttons in the toolbar above: Add/Edit/Delete. And right side will be a &quot;Project model field&quot;/&quot;File template field&quot; two columns table,  with two Add/Delete buttons.<br />
Clicking on the Add or Edit button of the &quot;Custom exports&quot; table will open the &quot;Edit custom export&quot; popup in which the admin can edit the name of the custom export, choose optionnally a single privacy group linked with this export, and must upload the expected file template. Each custom export in this list will be an hyperlink opening in the right side of the screen the list of fields mapping rules.<br />
On the right side of the screen, each row of the table will be a mapping between a project model field and a file template field. Those mappings can be edited by the &quot;Map custom export fields&quot; popup opened by clicking on a row or on the above &quot;Add&quot; button. This popup has two drop-down lists: left side is Project model field, and right side is File template field.<br />
<br />
<b>In the project end-user screen</b><br />
If there are custom export defined for a project model with a privacy group visible by the user, in all projects created from this model the &quot;Export&quot; button is transformed for this user from a simple button into a menu button in which he see not only the &quot;Project Synthesis&quot; Excel export, but also all custom exports which are visible for him. The list of exports in the menu are ordered by name ascending, and use icon corresponding to the file type.<br />

<td colspan="3">For a project model or an organizational unit model, a user can attach several custom exports.<br />
<br />
Each custom export has:<br />
o	A name (ie: “Concept note”)<br />
o	A location for the button to create the custom export (comprehensive list of the location for the Export drop-down menu buttons is: each phase, the “details” sub-tab, each opened report (the button will be then linked to the report flexible element in the model))<br />
o	A template (could be for example a LibreOffice Write or MS Word form, but other file types should be also available like LibreOffice Calc, MS Excel, csv, etc.) <br />
o	A mapping between the fields of the template and the fields of the linked project or organization unit model<br />
o	It would be also possible to link the fields of the template to fields of projects/orgunits linked to the project/orgunit generated from the project/orgunit model<br />
<br />
If the custom export is linked to a project model, a template field could be linked to :<br />
o	a field of a project model used as funding source<br />
o	an information of a project link to a project model used as funding source<br />
o	a field of a project model used as funded project<br />
o	an information of a project link to a project model used as funded project<br />
o	a field of an orgunit model used as parent orgunit of the project<br />
o	indicators of the project (see below for more information)<br />
o	logical framework of the project (see below for more information)<br />
<br />
<br />
If the custom export is linked to an orgunit model, a template field could be linked to :<br />
o	a field of an orgunit model used as parent orgunit of the orgunit<br />
o	indicators of the orgunit(see below for more information)<br />
<br />
If several projects match the project model of the linked field, the user will have to choose which project he want to use in his export.<br />
<br />
<br />
__Linking indicators to orgunit / project template__<br />
The solution to link indicators to an orgunit / project template could be discussed when this issue will be implemented. A solution could be:<br />
- in the custom export management screen, a field of the template could be linked to an element called &quot;indicators block&quot; (and all indicators will be inserted at the position of this field in the template)<br />
- when managing the link with the &quot;indicators block&quot;, the administrator has to define at least two text styles available in the template as style available for presenting (i) &quot;group of indicators&quot; and (ii) &quot;indicators&quot; themselves (more text styles could be use to present differently the various levels of groups of indicators)<br />
- a unique indicators presentation structure will be available at the beginning, but more should became available in the future (we can already imagine that we will need in a close future both a full text and a table presentation structure for this &quot;indicators block&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
__Linking logical framework to project template__<br />
The philosophy to implement the presentation of the logical framework in the template could be the same as the philosophy for indicators.</td>
