<td colspan="3">Amendments should be renamed &quot;Project core version&quot;.<br />
<br />
Project core versions are a way to keep track of modifications of the core logic of intervention of the project.<br />
The logic of intervention consists of:<br />
- the logical framework<br />
- all indicators attached to the logical framework (all their characteristics (name, target value...) except their value)<br />
- start and end dates of the project<br />
- planned budget field (or more precisely the budget sub-field used as ratio basis for budget progress computation)<br />
- any indicator set as &quot;part of the core logic of intervention&quot; of the project<br />
- any activity set as &quot;part of the core logic of intervention&quot; of the project<br />
- any field set as &quot;part of the core logic of intervention&quot; of the project in the model<br />
<br />
<b>Project core versions visualization</b><br />
In the top right corner project page (on the right of the banner), a box is set to manipulate Project core versions.<br />
A drop-down list will allow to set under which Project core versions should the project be seen (by default, the project will be seen as in the last version).<br />
In the drop-down list, all the available Project core versions will be listed like:<br />
#0 - 01/12/2012 - Initial version<br />
<a href="view681a.html?id=1" title="[closed] Crash when trying to access activityinfo's setup page" class="resolved">0000001</a> - 14/01/2013 - Revision of the number of beneficiaries<br />
<a href="view0b30.html?id=2" title="[new] Large Admin synchronization regions need to be batched">0000002</a> - open version<br />
<br />
On the right of this drop-down list, a button &quot;Display&quot; is available to change the project and show it with the value of all content of the logic of the project as freezed in the selected Project core version.<br />
Below the drop-down list, a button &quot;See version summary&quot; will open a popup which will list all the modifcations between the selected version and its previous version. In this popup the version of project core used as reference for comparison can be selected among all the previous versions to the one selected initially.<br />
Below this last drop-down list, a textfield &quot;Project core version title&quot; will be available to update the selected version title.<br />
The graphical design of this box should be revised to reply to the needs expressed by this draft graphical design.<br />
<br />
Each information which has been modified since the initial version will be highlighted through a small mark (an exclamation mark?) to inform the user that some changes have been made on it in a Project core version . By clicking on this small mark, a popup will open listing all the modifications made in each of the Project core version (with the number, date and title of the modification).<br />
<br />
If it is a past version which has been selected, when the user will navigate inside the project, he will see for each modified information the information as set in the version, as well as the present version (in a different color?) for comparison. Of course, the small mark will also available to see all the Project core versions made on this information.<br />
<br />
<b>Modifications workflow</b><br />
When a project is created, the version #0 is open for modification.<br />
A user with the required global privilege can lock a Project core version so that all information linked to it are no more open to modification.<br />
When a Project core version is locked, it can be validated by a user having another required global privilege, or unlocked by a user having the &quot;Lock Modification&quot; global privilege.<br />
When a user validates a Project core version, the user can enter a title for the version.<br />
When the last Project core version is validated and a user try to modify an information of the Project core, he will get a popup informing him:<br />
- if this user has the &quot;Create new Project core version&quot; global privilege: &quot;By modifying this information, you will create a new Project Core version. Do you want to continue?&quot;<br />
- if this user doesn't have this global privilege: &quot;This information is part of the Project core, and the current version of the project core is not open for modification. Ask someone with the required privilege to open the project core for modification&quot;. &lt;= this message will also be displayed if the project core version is locked.<br />

When a user validates a Project core version, the user enters a title for the versiona, and optionnally a comment.<br />
When the last Project core version is validated and a user try to modify an information of the Project core, he will get a popup informing him:<br />
- if this user has the &quot;Create new Project core version&quot; global privilege: &quot;By modifying this information, you will create a new Project Core version. Do you want to continue?&quot;<br />
- if this user doesn't have this global privilege: &quot;This information is part of the Project core, and the current version of the project core is not open for modification. Ask someone with the required privilege to open the project core for modification&quot;. &lt;= this message will also be displayed if the project core version is locked.<br />

- A new option will be available when setting up a checkbox field in a project model : &quot;Linked to a project core version&quot;: this checkbox will enable to force to create project core version in a phase (for example: to create a project core version in a &quot;Design&quot; phase)<br />
- Make Project core version management enabled/disabled in project model<br />
- The implementation of this feature should also take into account the implementation of issue <a href="view0741.html?id=180" title="[closed] Exclude Received budget and Spent budget from Amendment management" class="resolved">0000180</a> (Exclude Received budget and Spent budget from Amendment management) which needed to be rollbacked to fix issue <a href="view105c.html?id=548" title="[closed] Budget field always editable" class="resolved">0000548</a> (Budget field always editable). And this implementation should take into consideration implementation of issue <a href="viewd08d.html?id=386" title="[closed] Flexible budget field" class="resolved">0000386</a> (Flexible budget field).<br />
- Simple note to add to this feature the fact that the Excel project exportation should be made in the project core version currently loaded.<br />
So the implementation of this feature should revise as well partly the Excel exportation process. <br />
- A revert to an old version mechanism is also requested by the users as a secondary priority. This revert mechanism could also be thought to develop a revert mechanism for all common fields having a revision history.</td>
