<td colspan="3">A mockup of this screen is available here: <a href="mockups/Activities-subtab/index.html">http://www.sigmah.org/issues/mockups/Activities-subtab/</a> [<a href="mockups/Activities-subtab/index.html" target="_blank">^</a>]<br />
<br />
<br />
Graphically, this sub-tab will look like the main tab of the GWTGantt component (available at: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gwtgantt/">https://code.google.com/p/gwtgantt/</a> [<a href="https://code.google.com/p/gwtgantt/" target="_blank">^</a>]) with the following modifications:<br />
- new column: linked to logframe (to indicate that the row is also present in the logical framework)<br />
- new column: code (code of the task, activity, etc.)<br />
- new column: responsible (in replacement of &quot;&quot;resource&quot;&quot;) with the name of the responsible of the row<br />
- new column: Identification (in replacement of &quot;&quot;Task name&quot;&quot;)<br />
- removed columns from gwtgantt: Duration, Start, Finish, Duration &amp; Predecessors<br />
- new visual bar to represent the contractual planning in the last version of the project (for example, we could imagine to use a hashed bar behind the main bar to represent the contractual planning, and the main bar with transparent color over it would then represent the actual planning)<br />
- potentially, the progress bar of the activity should not be available (because of this representation of the contractual planning)<br />
- 2 filters should be added: a customized time period filter (enter start &amp; end date for the view), and an team filter (filter by &quot;&quot;whole team&quot;&quot;, a selection of specific positions (user profiles in Sigmah) or a selection of specific team members)<br />
<br />
When creating/updating a new row in the Gantt chart, the following attributes have to be set:<br />
- Type of row: Specific Objective, Expected Result, Activity, Task<br />
- checkbox for &quot;&quot;do not link to logical framework&quot;&quot; (unchecked by default)<br />
- Parent element: if linked to logframe and not Specific Objective, drop-down list to select the logframe parent element<br />
- Code<br />
- Planning (for activity &amp; task): mandatory start &amp; end dates, optional recurrences, plus manual settings of period when the activity/task has to be done<br />
- Conditionnal link to other activity: START-TO-START, FINISH-TO-START and FINISH-TO-FINISH links with other activities/tasks<br />
If the new row is linked to the logframe, the logframe will be automatically updated.<br />
<br />
Amendment management (actually not to be taken into account for this feature directly, but more for the amendement feature)<br />
To make this new sub-tab works as expected for their primary users which are project managers in the field, project managers should always be able to modify the content of the logframe for their daily needs, as if they always had a draft amendement to work on. In the original use case submitted by Handicap International, project managers would work only in the actual planning, and not on the contractual planning.<br />
<br />
Right management<br />
2 new global project privileges should be added: Update contractual planning, Update actual planning (see the Hide project/orgunit sub-tabs feature for more explanation on the concept of &quot;global project privilege&quot;)<br />
