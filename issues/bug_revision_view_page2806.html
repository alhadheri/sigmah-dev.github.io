<br />
A contact can be of 2 types: an Individual or an Organisation.<br />
Contacts are as flexible as Projects and Orgunits: all contacts must be created from Contact Models. And the admin can create as many Contact Models as desired. A Contact Model must be either from the Individual or the Organization type. Each Contact Model can have as many fields of characteristics as desired.<br />
<br />
This features adds a new field type: Contact relationship. This field can be configured to accept contacts only from a specific type (individual/organisation) or one or several contact models. This field can also be configured to accept a freely defined limit of number of contacts. This field is available for Project, Orgunit and Contact models. For Contact model, an additionnal optional can be set if the accepted contacts are only organisations for the field: &quot;is membership&quot;.<br />
<br />
An organisation contact page will have up to 4 sub-tabs: Characteristics, Child organisations, Members, Other relationships. The &quot;Child organisations&quot; and &quot;Members&quot; sub-tab will be filled with contact list of all contacts having a &quot;membership&quot; link with the organisation. If no organisation membership is possible, there will be no &quot;Child organisation&quot; sub-tab. Same for no &quot;Members&quot; if no individual membership.<br />
The &quot;Other relationships&quot; sub-tab will list all other relationships with all contacts, projects and orgunits.<br />
<br />
An individual contact page will look as an organisation contact page, but with only 2 sub-tabs: &quot;Characteristics&quot; and &quot;Relationships&quot;.<br />

<br />
In terms of rights:<br />
- each contact is attached to a unique organisational unit<br />
- the contact is visible by all users having the right to see its parent organisational unit<br />
- a contact can contain fields having a privacy group, and privacy group fields should behave as privacy groups fields for projects or orgunits<br />
- if a user is attached to several orgunits (see <a href="view0445.html?id=243" title="[closed] User attached to several OrgUnit" class="resolved">0000243</a>), its Contacts table on the dashboard will have its content updated according to the checked status of the &quot;Display only my main organisational unit&quot; checkbox: if checked (by default), only the contacts direct or indirect children of the main orgunit will be displayed, and if not all contacts direct or indirect children of all orgunits attached to the user will be displayed<br />
