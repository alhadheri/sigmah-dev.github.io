<br />
<b><i>General importation process:</i></b><br />
1. From anywhere the &quot;Import&quot; button is clicked (global menu, contacts table, contact list field), the same &quot;Import&quot; popup will open.<br />
<br />
2. Once opened, the &quot;Import&quot; popup will ask first only to select the Importation framework in a drop-down list of all Importation frameworks available. If a user has not the right to import contact (&quot;Import contacts&quot; global privilege not checked), or not the the right to import other entities than contacts (&quot;IMPORT_BUTTON&quot; global privilege not checked), then the Importation framework drop-down list will be filtered accordingly: only importation frameworks which are linked to models of entities to which the user can import will be listed.<br />
<br />
3. Once the framework is selected, if it is linked to models of different entities (ie: project and orgunit, contact and project, etc.), a list of 3 radiobuttons project/organisational unit/contact will be displayed prefixed by the label &quot;Importing to:&quot;. The radiobuttons will be enabled/disabled according the right of the user to import to those kind of objects. And for each radiobutton, if the entity is linked to the framework and if the user has the right to import to that entity, the radiobutton will be checked by default.<br />
<br />
4. At the same time the list of 3 radiobuttons will be displayed, the rest of the popup will be displayed, but with the label &quot;Create a new project when no match is found&quot; replaced by &quot;Create a new entity when no match is found&quot;.<br />
<br />
5. If the importation will import contacts, the &quot;Verify each match&quot; mode will be disabled, and the &quot;Unlock the project core if necessary&quot; checkbox is disabled and unchecked. Moreover, after clicking on the &quot;Import&quot; button, the imported file will be completely parsed and a deduplication check for each file entry will be made. <br />
<br />
6. If the importation will import contacts, at the end of the importation a final &quot;Summary of the contact importation&quot; popup will open with the following informations: <br />
* &quot;File entries summary&quot; (label)<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Total number of file entries&quot;<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Number of contacts created&quot;<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Number of contacts updated&quot;<br />
<br />
<b><i>Importing from contact list field specific importation process:</i></b><br />
<i>When importing contacts from a contact list field, the importation must not only create contacts but also attach contacts in this list. As a consequence, the General importation process is modified as follows from step 2 onward:</i><br />
<br />
2. Once opened, the &quot;Import&quot; popup will ask first only to select the Importation framework in a drop-down list of all Importation frameworks available. The Importation framework drop-down list content will be filtered accordingly: only importation frameworks which are linked to contact models matching the constraints of the contact list field will be listed (constraints in terms of individual/organisation types, or specific contact model restrictions. If the contact list only accepts a single contact model, the &quot;Importation framework&quot; drop-down list will be set to this unique possible value, will be disabled and the popup will thus directly display also content displayed from step 3 of this process.<br />
<br />
3. Unlike the General importation process step 3, no entities radiobuttons can be displayed when importing into a contact list.<br />
<br />
<i>4. Similar to General importation process step 4.<br />

&#160;&#160;- &quot;Total number of file entries&quot;<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Number of contacts created&quot;<br />

* &quot;Contact list field modification summary&quot; (label)<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Number of contacts added to the list&quot;<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Number of contacts not added because exceeding the number of contact's limit of the field&quot;<br />

<br />
6. If the importation will import contacts, and if there are potential duplicates, at the bottom center of the screen a modal popup will open titled &quot;Contacts importation deduplication&quot;/&quot;Dédoublonnage de l'import de contacts&quot; with only a single progress bar inside it with the label: &quot;Potential duplicate X/Y&quot; (with &quot;y&quot; being the total number of potential duplicates just found). And as soon as this modal popup will open, a popup of higher importance will open at the center of the screen: the popup for deduplication control for the first potential duplicate.<br />
<br />
7. Each time the user will have finished his decision on the potential duplicate, the progress bar will be updated in the &quot;Contacts importation deduplication&quot; modal popup, and the popup for deduplication control will be called once again for the next potential duplicate.<br />
<br />
8. When the last potential duplicate will have been managed, all popups will close and a final &quot;Summary of the contact importation&quot; popup will open with the following informations: <br />
* &quot;File entries summary&quot; (label)<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Total number of file entries&quot;<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Number of contacts created&quot;<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Number of contacts updated&quot;<br />
* &quot;Deduplication summary&quot; (label)<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Total number of potential duplicates&quot;<br />
&#160;&#160;- &quot;Number of potential duplicates considered as new contacts&quot;<br />
