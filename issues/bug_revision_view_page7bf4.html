<td colspan="3">To be able to modify a project/orgunit models even though project/orgunit have been created from them, the following minor modifications should be allowed on &quot;Available&quot; models:<br />
- add new fields<br />
- add new groups<br />
- delete empty groups<br />
- rename fields and groups (but not change its type)<br />
- increase the limits of fields (increase number of allowed files, increase max number of characters), but decrease not allowed<br />
- move a field inside the same container (change of group, position)<br />
- disable fields: disabled fields won't be anymore visible if not in closed phase<br />
- modify the field's mandatory status (for existing projects whose phase containing an empty not mandatory field becoming now mandatory is closed, technical feasability should be checked: does it created a problem to have closed phase with mandotory field empty?)<br />
- for report fields, be able to change the attached report model so that new reports created from that field will use the new model ; for old reports created from old report model, there will be no change (all reports - new and old - will be visible in the 'report and documents)<br />
- for list of choice field: be able to add new items in the list, or disable an existing item (disabled items won't be anymore available to be selected as value for fields which haven't yet selected a value, but will remain the value for fields which have already selected them)<br />
- modify the content of the project/orgunit banner<br />
- increase the maximum limits of number of elements in the logframe (ie: increase number of expected results, add possibility to have groups for specific objectives, etc.)<br />
- change privacy groups attached to a field<br />
<br />
The following major modifications are not allowed:<br />
- adding or removing a phase<br />
- modify the core version of the project (disable amendable fields, or set as &quot;amendable&quot; fields which are not yet amendable)<br />
- modification of type of existing fields<br />
<br />
To make those model modifications without too much impact on the users, &quot;Available &amp; used&quot; models can be set to a temporary secondary status: &quot;Under maintenance&quot;. A new &quot;Under maintenance&quot; checkbox will be available in the project/orgunit model banner: when checked, the administrator can set a timer (30 minutes by default) to let user know when their project will be no more accessible because &quot;under maintenance&quot;. As soon as the admin check this checkbox, user having opened a project using this project model will be an information in the banner of the project : &quot;Your project will be temporary no more accessible for maintenance in XX minutes&quot;. As soon as the admin unckeck the checkbox, the projects/orgunit become normally accessible again. The admin must check this checkbox to be allowed to do all the allowed minor modifications on &quot;Available&quot; project/orgunit models, and he will be allowed to do those modifications only after the timer he has set has elapsed.</td>

We could maybe add another status &quot;locked&quot; to be sure that a specific model won't be modified by users not having the right privilege.<br />

Similar need has been expressed for the orgunit models.</td>
