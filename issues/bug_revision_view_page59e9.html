<td colspan="3">All NGOs use a separate software to keep track of their accounting information. To avoid double data entry, an importing data feature should be created to allow fast transfer of information between separate systems.<br />
<br />
Periodically, NGOs are already exporting preformated MS Excel files from their accounting system. Those files may be one for several projects, or one per project depending on the accounting system used. So far, NGOs using Sigmah have reported using EpiConcept Saga or MS Navision.<br />
<br />
The aim of this feature is to use those preformated MS Excel exports as a source to import financial data into Sigmah.<br />
<br />
A new concept: the importation scheme.<br />
The importation scheme is the definition of how to handle a specific importation format, which information can be extracted out of it, and how to ensure that a specific spreadsheet is valid to be used. At best, a scheme should be able to handled other format than MS Excel (LibreOffice Draw, csv, etc.).<br />
Those importation schemes should be managed in the administration part of the application.<br />
<br />
A new tab in project modes management: importations<br />
In this tab, the administrator can set for several importation schemes, how the extracted information from the scheme can be used to be imported in fields of the project (including the multiple spend budget fields), and how should be made the joint between fields of the project and extracted information from the scheme.<br />
<br />
A new action: import data.<br />
This action will be available as a new button on the main menu. A global privilege will be attached to it.<br />
After clicking on this button, the user will see a popup with:<br />
- a drop-down list of all importation schemes available (he has to choose one)<br />
- a file browser to select either a folder or a specific file to import (we can add a radiobutton field before this filebrowser field to let hime choose between file or folder import)<br />
- an &quot;Import&quot; button<br />
<br />
After clicking on import, he will see a screen describing to him all the imports ready to occur (with project identification, old and new value, etc.). If the user has no right to modifiy one field impact from a project which should be modified with this import, this screen will inform him that this project won't be modified as a whole with this import because he doesn't have sufficient privileges.<br />
If the user then clicks on &quot;Validate&quot;, all operations described will take place.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note : the description of this feature remains a bit loose on purpose. The implementation of this feature may vary according to potential technical solutions, and in particular available libraries which may exist.</td>
